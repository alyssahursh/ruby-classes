    <h1>Ruby Classes, Explained with Outfits</h1>
    <p>
      Struggling to understand Ruby classes and instances? Let me try to explain it with something you do every day (whether you like it or not): create an outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the idea of outfits fit the idea of Ruby Classes, let's pretend you have a little bit of a style uniform: Every day, your outfit consists of a top, a bottom, a hijab, a pair of shoes, and a piece of jewelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a new outfit, you need to specify five items.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="two columns">
        <h5>
          Here's a helpful drawing:
        </h5>
        <img src="assets/class_Outfit.JPG" />
      </div>
      <div class="two columns">
        <h5>
          And here's some Ruby code:
        </h5>

        <div class="code">
<pre><code>class Outfit
  attr_accessor :top, :bottom, :hijab, :shoes, :jewelry

  def initialize(top, bottom, hijab, shoes, jewelry)
    @top = top
    @bottom = bottom
    @hijab = hijab
    @shoes = shoes
    @jewelery = jewelery
  end

end</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          This Ruby class called "Outfit" is just the code that tells you what an outfit is made of. It says: when you want to make a new outfit, you'll need to specify a top, bottom, hijab, shoes, and jewelry.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <h2>
      So, let's get dressed.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Monday, you put together a new outfit, and you name it <b>monday_outfit</b>.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="two columns">
        <h5>
          Here's a helpful drawing:
        </h5>
        <img src="assets/monday_outfit.JPG" />
      </div>
      <div class="two columns">
        <h5>
          And here's some Ruby code:
        </h5>

        <div class="code">
<pre><code>monday_outfit = Outfit.new(
  "blue polka dot shirt",
  "navy jeans",
  "teal scarf",
  "black pointy flats",
  "sapphire earrings")</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          This code says: Make a new <b>instance</b> of the class "Outfit," call it "monday_outfit" and hold on to the details about the top, bottom, hijab, shoes, and jewelry.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

  <h2>
    Cool, cool. Now it's Tuesday.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's make another outfit and call it <b>tuesday_outfit</b>
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="two columns">
      <h5>
        Here's a helpful drawing:
      </h5>
      <img src="assets/tuesday_outfit.JPG" />
    </div>
    <div class="two columns">
      <h5>
        And here's some Ruby code:
      </h5>

      <div class="code">
<pre><code>tuesday_outfit = Outfit.new(
  "brown and white striped shirt",
  "peach skirt",
  "orange scarf",
  "brown loafers",
  "orange bead necklace")</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        This code says: Make a <b>another</b> new <b>instance</b> of the class "Outfit," call it "tuesday_outfit" and hold on to the details about the top, bottom, hijab, shoes, and jewelry.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <h2>
    Don't stop there! It's Wednesday!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's make another outfit and call it <b>wednesday_outfit</b>
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="two columns">
      <h5>
        Here's a helpful drawing:
      </h5>
      <img src="assets/wednesday_outfit.JPG" />
    </div>
    <div class="two columns">
      <h5>
        And here's some Ruby code:
      </h5>

      <div class="code">
<pre><code>wednesday_outfit = Outfit.new(
  "green and white chevron shirt",
  "purple skirt",
  "green scarf",
  "purple striped shoes",
  "pink gem earrings")</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        This code says: Make a <b>yet another</b> new <b>instance</b> of the class "Outfit," call it "wednesday_outfit" and hold on to the details about the top, bottom, hijab, shoes, and jewelry.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <h2>
    You're probably getting the idea, but I drew more pictures!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's make <b>thursday_outfit</b>
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="two columns">
      <h5>
        Here's a helpful drawing:
      </h5>
      <img src="assets/thursday_outfit.JPG" />
    </div>
    <div class="two columns">
      <h5>
        And here's some Ruby code:
      </h5>

      <div class="code">
<pre><code>thursday_outfit = Outfit.new(
  "purle heart shirt",
  "gray leggings",
  "purple scarf",
  "gray sneakers",
  "black earrings")</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        This code says: Make a <b>yet another</b> new <b>instance</b> of the class "Outfit," call it "thursday_outfit" and hold on to the details about the top, bottom, hijab, shoes, and jewelry.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <h2>
    Thank god it's Friday!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's wrap up the week with <b>friday_outfit</b>
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="two columns">
      <h5>
        Here's a helpful drawing:
      </h5>
      <img src="assets/friday_outfit.JPG" />
    </div>
    <div class="two columns">
      <h5>
        And here's some Ruby code:

      <div class="code">
<pre><code>friday_outfit = Outfit.new(

  "yellow skirt",
  "pink scarf",
  "pink flats",
  "gold chevron necklace")</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        This code says: Make a <b>yet another</b> new <b>instance</b> of the class "Outfit," call it "friday_outfit" and hold on to the details about the top, bottom, hijab, shoes, and jewelry.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <h2>Great, but why is this useful?</h2>
  <p>
    Now that we have all these instances, we can get information from them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Like, hey, what bottom did I wear on Tuesday?</b>
  </p>
  <div class="code">
<pre><code>puts tuesday_outfit.bottom</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    returns
  </p>
  <div class="code">
<pre><code>peach skirt</code></pre>
  </div>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>Or, which hijab did I wear on Friday?</b>
  </p>
  <div class="code">
<pre><code>puts friday_outfit.hijab</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    returns
  </p>
  <div class="code">
<pre><code>pink scarf</code></pre>
  </div>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    <b>We can even update an outfit:</b>
  </p>
  <div class="code">
<pre><code>wednesday_outfit.shoes = "navy converse"
puts wednesday_outfit.shoes</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    returns
  </p>
  <div class="code">
<pre><code>navy converse</code></pre>
  </div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
  <p>
    <b>Or test if an aspect of an outfit matches a particular string:</b>
  </p>
  <div class="code">
<pre><code>puts monday_outfit.top = "blue polka dot shirt"</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    returns
  </p>
  <div class="code">
<pre><code>true</code></pre>
  </div>
